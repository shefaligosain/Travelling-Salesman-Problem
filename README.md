# Travelling-Salesmen-Problem
Implement any scheme to find the optimal solution for the Traveling Salesperson problem and then solve the same problem instance using any approximation algorithm and determine the error in the approximation.

PROGRAM LOGIC: 
1. Check for the disconnection between the current city and the next city 
2. Check whether the travelling salesperson has visited all the cities 
3. Find the next city to be visited 
4. Find the solution and terminate.
OUTPUT: 
1) First Enter the Number to Vertices (n) of G(V,E).
2) Then enter the Cost Matrix C[I,j].
3) Enter source vertex (say 1) and (i) find optimal solution with brute force method (By showing all permutations) (ii) Optimal solution with either nearest neighbor method (or any other TSP solving problem) (iii) and finally find the error in the approximation as ((solution_of_Nearrest_neighbour method/brut_force_method)-1)*100).
